To use this cupcake ordering system you have to first download the python source code file and the two images. Make sure that the source code and the images are in the same folder, so that the python source code can find the images. After you download those files, you can browse the menu at the top of the screen to see the cupcake options and prices. Below the menu you will find the ordering section, you can write a number in the text box for how many of each dozen cupcake flavors you want. If you leave the text box blank it will count as a zero and signify that you do not want any cupcakes in that flavor. If you make a mistake with the inputs, you can press the Reset button to reset the entry boxes. Once you put the number in for how many of each dozen cupcake flavors you want and are finished you can press the Order Now button to get a receipt of the total price for the cupcakes you wanted. If you would like to exit the program at any time you can press the Exit button to exit the program.
